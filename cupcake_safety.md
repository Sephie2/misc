**Health and Safety Warning: Rakghoul-Infused Cupcakes**

**Warning: Consumption of these cupcakes may cause an uncontrollable urge to join the dark side (complete with ominous breathing).**

Dear valued cupcake enthusiast,

Before diving into the gooey, delicious center of these cupcakes, a few crucial points:

**Rakghoul Vaccine Required:** To safely enjoy these delectable treats, ensure you've received your Rakghoul Vaccine. Failure to do so may result in sudden transformations, uncontrollable snarling, and an overwhelming desire to gnaw on the nearest droid.

**Side Effects:** Even with the vaccine, side effects might include but are not limited to:

- Excessive saber waving
- Spontaneous use of Force lightning
- A peculiar craving for bantha milk

**Handling Instructions:** Please use a lightsaber (or at the very least, a sturdy fork) to cut into these cupcakes. Attempting to bite directly into them may lead to unexpected forcefields or an explosion of glittery frosting.

**Storage:** Keep these cupcakes in a secure containment field, far away from young padawans and overly curious Jawas. Exposure to moisture might result in gooey transformations and potentially a small-scale rebellion.

**Emergency Protocol:** In the unlikely event of a Rakghoul outbreak post-consumption:

- Isolate the infected individual immediately.
- Contact the nearest Jedi Council for assistance.
- Remember, offering them another cupcake is not a solution, no matter how tasty it looks.



Enjoy your cupcakes responsibly, and may the frosting be with you!
